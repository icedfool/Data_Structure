ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  <20>



ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE OF YOUR ALGORITHM:
(order notation & concise paragraph, < 200 words)
The dimensions of the board (h and w)? 
The number of tiles (t)? 
The number of road (r) and city (c) edges? 
The number of duplicate tiles?
Whether rotations are allowed?  
Etc. 

I failed to do the implementation of this homework since Im poor at
writing recursions, but I can simply describe my thoughts.
so first the algorithem should detect if current tile is able not the the edge,
if it isn't,then try to link second tile to that,and detect if the location of second 
tile is avalible, and if it is not, pass this try and keep linking till all 
the tile is linked.

SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE OF YOUR PROGRAM ON THE PROVIDED PUZZLES:
# of solutions & approximate wall clock running time for different
puzzles with various command line arguments.

i don't actually know since I never made it...

MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
(optional, please be concise!)
I think im doomed this time...
